# What is Thoughts and Stuff?
Thoughts and Stuff is a place for me to get my thoughts about Apple, and tech in general, out of my head. Occasionally, I might write about travel, education, or football[^1], too. 

# Who writes all this stuff?
This website is written and run by [Karan Varindani][1]. You can find some of my older work at me [301][2] and at [Shining Paradigm][3]. I’m constantly looking for ways to make the site better, so you’ll often find me tweaking the code and other things you probably won’t notice. Feel free to [get in touch][4].

# Tell me more about the site
Thoughts and Stuff is a static [Jekyll][5] site hosted on a [Linode][6] server[^2]. The theme is a modified version of the default [Minima][8] theme, and somewhat mimics that of [Shining Paradigm][9]. All posts are written in Ulysses ([Mac][10], [iOS][11]). The site's colors and [logo][16][^3] were provided by my friend, [John Branagan][15]. Consider him for your graphic design needs. 

# Do you have an RSS Feed?
Of course. ([XML][12], [JSON][13])

# How does the site make money?
It doesn't. I started this website as a way for me to improve my web development and server management skills, and because I quite enjoy writing the things I do here. ~~I do use iTunes Affiliate links though!~~ ([RIP](https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-apps-and-in-app-purchases-will-be-removed-from-its-affiliate-program-october-1st/))

[^1]: The real one. I believe some of you (wrongly) call it "soccer."

[^2]:	I love Linode. They're a fantastic company, and you should strongly [consider them][7] if you have any server needs.

[^3]:	The logo is an adaptation of [the flag of Ghana][14] (my home country), with the colors changed to reflect the layout of the website.
