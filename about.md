# What is Thoughts and Stuff?
Thoughts and Stuff is a place for me to get my thoughts about Apple and tech in general out of my head. Occasionally, I might write about travel, education, or football[^1], too. 

# Who writes all this stuff?
This website is written and run by [Karan Varindani][1]. You can sometimes find me on Medium at [301][2], and you can find some of my older work at [Shining Paradigm][3]. Iâ€™m constantly looking for ways to make the site better, so youâ€™ll often find me tweaking the code and other things you probably wonâ€™t notice. Feel free to [get in touch][4].

# Tell me more about the site
Thoughts and Stuff is a static [Jekyll][5] site hosted on a [Linode][6] server[^2]. The theme is a modified version of the default [Minima][8] theme, and somewhat mimics that of [Shining Paradigm][9]. All posts are written in Ulysses ([Mac][10], [iOS][11]). The site's colors and [logo][16][^3] were provided by my friend, [John Branagan][15]. Consider him for your graphic design needs. 

# Do you have an RSS Feed?
[Of course][12].

# Do you have accept donations?
[Of course][13].[^4]

# How does the site make money?
It doesn't. I started this website as a way for me to improve my web development and server management skills, and because I quite enjoy writing the things I do here. I do use iTunes Affiliate links though, and accept donations (as we just discussed! ðŸ˜‰).

[^1]: The real one. I believe some of you (wrongly) call it "soccer."

[^2]:	I love Linode. They're a fantastic company, and you should strongly [consider them][7] if you have any server needs.

[^3]:	The logo is an adaptation of [the flag of Ghana][17] (my hometown), with the colors changed to reflect the layout of the website. 

[^4]:	Jokes aside, this website is a fun side project but it runs without ads and costs me money. If you enjoy reading something here, donations are always much appreciated â€” they're handled securely by [Square Cash][14].
